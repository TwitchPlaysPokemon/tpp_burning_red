# Design Notes

## Glitch City

* Glitch City dimensions, blocks, warps and movement permissions are identical to Red
* The trees grow back as soon as a step is taken (may not be possible to replicate)

### Phancero Encounter

* Encounter with Phancero, lv. 70  
* If the player kills Phancero or runs away, they are warped back the Celadon City to emerge from the Battle Tent  

### Warps

* If the player leaves Glitch City (through the door of the Gym), they are warped back the Celadon City to emerge from the Battle Tent
* There is a warp to a Glitch Battle Tent interor
* There are random doors placed throughout the map that warp the player to the same spot - this will force a change between Red and FireRed

### Connections

* The map is connected to itself to create an infinite map
* Top and bottom connections have no offsets
* Left offset: 7
* Right offset: -7

## Celadon City

* A door has been added to the house across the water
* The man has moved
* There is a strength and cut puzzle in front of the door
* The Battle Tent is present but is not accessible
* When a player walks to the door and presses A, text reads:
    ```
    It's locked up tight.
    The building looks abandoned...
    ```
* There is a sign outside the Battle Tent which reads:
    ```
    BATTLE TENT
    ...
    The sign is scratched and faded.
    It's impossible to read further...
    ```
